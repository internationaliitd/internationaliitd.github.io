						<h2>Life in Delhi:  Travel and Safety</h2>

							<p>The capital of the largest democracy, housing more than 18 million people, Delhi is second most developed and is one of the most vibrant, dynamic and diverse city. A trip to Delhi is bound to absorb the visitor in different layers of intriguing perspective and never let go of the experiences. There is more intertwined history than one can think of, unique inner peace amidst the chaotic lifestyle and rich cultural diversity that very much justifies the Indian integrity.</p>

							<p>The rich heritage and infrastructure Delhi enjoys today are attributed to the long history which dates back 5000 years during which the city has repeatedly desolated and revived, with the vestiges of lost empires in almost every neighborhood. The Mughals followed by British were the last to rule. This also the reason how Delhi incorporates such a magnificent blend of western culture along with the traditional Indian culture which you get to witness when you travel from Old Delhi, where you find shopkeepers selling stuffs in their small crammed shops, labors hauling sacks on their back or carts and people devouring the street foods; to the modern New Delhi with its colonial-era buildings, glitzy malls and markets, broadways, skyscraping apartments and offices. </p>

							<h3>Settling and Getting Around in Delhi</h3>

							<p>The IIT Delhi campus is one of the most peaceful and safest place in Delhi. This 320 acres campus is very well patrolled 24*7 by security guards spread across the entire premise. The general stores and buffets along with the local markets just outside the gates make it quite a self-sufficient place. But obviously, when you are living in a city with such a rich history and culture manifested by magnificent archaeological sites, lively and comprehensive markets and famous eateries, there would never be a weekend when you can not find a place to explore. Here are some of the places which you should visit in Delhi :</p>

							<h4>Archaeological Sites</h4>

							<p> Red Fort, India Gate, Jama Masjid, Akshardham temple, Lotus temple, Taj Mahal-Agra (approx.250km. from Delhi)</p>

							<h4>Markets</h4>

							<p>Expensive and branded products - Connaught Place and Khan Market <br> 
							Local Markets- Palika Bazaar, Janpath, Sarojini Market, Lajpat Nagar Market, Chandni Chowk, Dilli  Haat
							</p>

							<h4>Places to Eat</h4>

							<p>Old Delhi, Connaught Place, Satya Niketan, SDA Market, Hudson Lane.</p>

							<h3>Travelling in Delhi :</h3>

							<p>Delhi is a large city with decent infrastructure and connectivity to all the important places. As with other metropolis around the globe, road transportation becomes hectic at peak time due to traffic jams. But at the same time for short distances and places with no other means of direct transportation, travelling on road becomes inevitable.</p>

							<p>Among all the means of transportation, <b>Delhi metro</b> is the safest, cheapest and the one of the fastest mode and should be always preferred over others. It has been a boon to daily commuters and with over 1.5 million people travelling daily it has been one of the most preferred public transportation.</p>


							<p>For comparison, on average, fare of auto-rickshaw from IIT Delhi, Hauz Khas to Red Fort, Chandni Chowk is approximately Rs.180 and for <b>OLA</b> and <b>UBER cabs</b> it is about Rs.150 and they take more than an hour and a quarter to reach there, whereas the fare for metro is only Rs.40 and it takes 25 minutes to reach there. Sometimes you have to pay an additional charge of Rs10-40 (depending on the place) to reach to a metro station by rickshaw or auto-rickshaw, but it is worth travelling by metro because it saves you a lot of time and is much safer, especially with the first coach reserved for women.</p>


							<p><b>DTC buses</b> are also quicker means of transport effective especially for shorter transit with fares even low and not more than Rs.15 for ordinary and Rs.25 for AC buses.</p>


							<p><b>Rickshaw</b> and <b>auto-rickshaw</b> are useful for shorter distance when you want to reach a fixed destination. But there is always a scope of bargaining in auto-rickshaw and rickshaw given the fact that they always overcharge the expats and someone new to the place. It is always recommended that you have a fair idea of the price beforehand. If you have a doubt about the means of transportation to use or fares, do not hesitate to <b>ask the local citizens</b> - especially shopkeepers and street hawkers.</p>

							<h3>Safety- Advice and Tips: </h3>

							<p>Some of the places in Delhi especially the ones in Central and South Delhi have embraced western culture very well and anyone who loves to enjoy the nightlife, café, shopping and gardens will definitely have a pleasant experience here. The streets are peaceful and have big stores and shopping complexes. There is no restriction whatsoever to any form of entertainment based on gender or race. On the other hand, North Delhi, especially the Old Delhi region is very representative of the traditional Indian culture and profession. People from all over the world love to enjoy the varied Indian cuisine and visit archaeological sites here. Unlike South Delhi, the streets here are quite lively, feature small shops and eateries.</p>


							<p>The crime rate and other stats pertaining to safety and well-being should be taken with a pinch of salt because what doesn’t go into account is the amount of negligence shown that makes a person vulnerable. But let’s face it, Delhi is a large city and one cannot expect every corner of the city to be safe, especially at night. The prominent and the crowded places are generally safe and as long as travelling at night is avoided, you can safely plan an excursion. A person is expected to be little alert, careful and plan things well to ensure safety. Having a right attitude and little knowledge about the local culture will definitely enhance your experience in Delhi.</p>

							<p>Here are some of the safety-measures especially for women:
							<br><ul>
							<li>if you are travelling to a crowded place, you must be alert and careful about your belongings.</li>
							<li>try to have a company of your friends if you are travelling to secluded areas after 8 p.m.</li>
							<li>use metro ride as much as possible. Ola and Uber cabs should be preferred for short distances at night.</li>
							</p>

							<h2>WOMEN SAFETY IN DELHI</h2>

							<p>To all the ladies out there !!</p>

							<p>What comes to your mind when you plan for studies or an exchange abroad? Ready to enter the new world of learning, interacting with new cultures, browsing the places to visit, booking tickets and hotels, making weekend plans, filled up with joy to explore the other part of the world and make it ours. Plans to eat from the most expensive shop to street food, buying from a street vendor to a five-star mall. Everything is all set to go. Just when it strikes, is it Delhi that I have to visit! The plans shatter to half of that was thought of!</p>

							<p>“Delhi is unsafe for women” is heard from a large population, even those who haven't been through the lanes of this beautiful city seen as a melting pot of cultures, rich heritage, and beautiful extremes.</p>

							<p>Why should you question yourself about safety in Delhi? Did you ever ponder over that are you even safe anywhere in the world taking in account factors that include rape, pollution, landslides to anything?</p>

							<!-- <p><i>If we could find any stats?</i></p> -->

							<p>The times have changed, the scenario of Delhi has improved in respect to safety for women by the development of Instant help apps to amendments in Cab like Uber and Ola rules.</p>

							<!-- <p><i>We can add a bit about the recent improvements by Delhi govt in women safety some of which I have mentioned at the end of the article, maybe we can put it as hyperlink</i></p> -->

							<p>Listen to people just like you, an exchange student sharing the most amazing experiences:</p>

							<p>“ I will say one thing to women who are thinking about traveling to Delhi,… Do it. Now. Stop reading cautionary horror stories from narrow-minded twats who never leave their sofas.</p>
							<p>I had an amazing time in Delhi! It truly is “The City of Kings”.I felt safe in Delhi, it felt like home to me. “- Franny Burstein (<a href="https://www.quora.com/Is-Delhi-safe-for-Women">https://www.quora.com/Is-Delhi-safe-for-Women</a>)</p>
							
							<p>“I am a foreigner and I am living in India round about 2 years I feel very safe here Alhamdula.“ -Hadia Baoshan</p>

							<p>Every city has its safe and unsafe areas, it is the responsibility of the government and police to take over the situation over the safety, which has been looked upon by the Delhi government quite minutely now.</p>

							<p>Moreover, one can just be safe by taking a few steps that might lead you in trouble be it in Delhi or any other place in the world. For instance:  Female visitors to Delhi do need to take particular care. It is just not the done thing to go up to a group of men and ask for directions. Instead, go into a shop or a cafe to read a map or ask for help.</p>
							 
							<p>Step down and experience the marvel that this wondrous city offers you.</p>


							<hr>

							<p>I would like to point out the steps that have been proposed/taken by the Delhi Govt and Police:</p>

							<ol>
							<li>On 25th March - In the first phase, CCTV cameras will be installed at vulnerable points within the jurisdiction of 44 police stations where the crime graph against women is higher.</li>

							<li>Delhi University - Police pickets at strategic points, emergency response vehicles, quick response teams, anti eve-teasing teams deployed, CCTV cameras, self-defence training programs, mobile and foot patrolling intensified and complaint boxes at various colleges &amp; hostels.</li>

							<li>Delhi Police Initiatives - Women's Helpline Number 1091; An Anti-Stalking Service for women, "Himmat" Mobile Safety App for women, the Himmat Whatsapp Group and the Facebook page for feedback.</li>

							<li>Public Transport - In June 2015, 2000 Home Guard marshals were deployed across the buses of state-run Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC). The Home Guards reported to regional managers of DTC who in turn deployed these marshals on different checking beats throughout the capital.</li>

							<li>OTR One Touch Response App - Personal safety app in which subscribers can activate safe tracking services, which monitor them as they travel through unsafe areas or when traveling at odd hours. OTR offers a single point of contact for all situations such as personal safety monitoring, managing physical threats, road accidents and medical emergencies or on road assistance.</li>

							<li>Sept 2015 - a Pilot project to install CCTV cameras in schools was started with installation in two of the three government schools of Delhi - Mori Gate and East Vinod Nagar. Government authorities - including the Department of Education -- will initially monitor the cameras. Later, the plan is to provide a secure access for parents to through a mobile application, so they can keep an eye on their children. Installation of overall 70,000 CCTVs combined in all 700 schools of Delhi is planned for now.</li>

							<li>Aug 2015 - The women workforce in PCR vans will be increased to 500 in the coming days so that there is a greater presence of women police personnel on the streets.</li>

							<li>Cab Service Ola &amp; Uber - AAP government decided not to compromise with Delhi's women safety by directing the companies to only run taxis which have GPS and Delhi government license, to operate in the capital.</li>

							<li>Delhi Govt - proposed Charter of Women’s Rights Bill, 2015, which aims at strengthening Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) by giving it more administrative and judicial powers, and will incorporate recommendation made by Justice J.S. Verma Committee in the wake of the Nirbhaya rape case.</li>

							</ol>
